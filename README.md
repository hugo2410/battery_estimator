### Description
This project is an introduction to scientific programming in C ++. It is registered as part of the Programming Concepts in Scientific Computing course(https://edu.epfl.ch/coursebook/fr/programming-concepts-in-scientific-computing-MATH-458).

The objective of the project is the creation of a Monte Carlo algorithm in a modular way. To do this, the following objectives have been achieved :
* Implementation of random number generators with a normal & uniform probability distribution.
* The compute of the expectation value of a user-defined function
* The visualization of the statistical moments
* The graphical verification of Central Limit Theorem (CTL)

### How It Works

To run the executable, the following information must be written to the terminal :

'./battery_estimator  name_of_waypoint_file name_of_winddata_file' .
